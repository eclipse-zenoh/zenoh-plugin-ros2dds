# Examples of Zenoh applications communicating with ROS 2 Nodes

This directory contains some examples of applications using the Zenoh APIs only (not ROS 2), and that can communicate with ROS 2 Nodes using CycloneDDS as RMW, via the `zenoh-bridge-ros2dds`.

> :warning: The code of those examples are made to work with the version 0.10.x of the `zenoh-plugin-ros2dds` or `zenoh-bridge-ros2dds`. Soon both will be adapted for compatibility with the incoming `rmw_zenoh`, implying some code change in those examples.
